- Types of networks (LAN, WAN)
- Basic idea of data transmission

## OSI Model (High-level understanding)
- Application
- Presentation
- Session
- Transport
- Network
- Data Link
- Physical

## Purpose of OSI Model
- Helps in troubleshooting
- Identifies where a problem occurs in a network

## Reflection
I understand networking conceptually, and I expect deeper clarity as I continue learning and practicing.
