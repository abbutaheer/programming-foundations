# Introduction to Data Structures

## What is a Data Structure?
A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be used efficiently.

## Important Note
- Data Structure is NOT a program
- It is a method or concept used in algorithms

## Why We Use Data Structures
- Efficient data storage
- Faster access and modification
- Better memory usage
- Helps solve complex problems

## Examples
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs

## Reflection
This session helped me understand why data structures are essential in programming and problem-solving.
