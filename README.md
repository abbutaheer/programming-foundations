# Programming Foundations

This repository documents my foundational learning in programming as part of my BCA degree and self-study.
The goal of this repository is to clearly explain *how programs work*, not just how to write code.

## What this repository covers
- Java fundamentals and execution model
- Primitive data types and memory awareness
- Basic compilation and execution using command line
- Introduction to data structures and algorithms (conceptual understanding)

## Why this repository exists
Instead of jumping directly into advanced topics, I am focusing on building strong fundamentals.
This repository reflects my learning in my own words and will grow as I progress academically.
                                                                                                                                        
## Learning approach
- Concepts written in simple language
- Focus on *why* something works
- Command-line based execution where applicable

> This repository is part of my long-term preparation for cybersecurity and penetration testing roles.
