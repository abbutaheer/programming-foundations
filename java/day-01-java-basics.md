# Day 01 – Java Basics

## What I learned

- Java programs are compiled using `javac` and run using `java`
- Structure of a Java program

## Primitive Data Types
- byte
- short
- int
- long
- float
- double
- char
- boolean

## Sizes of Data Types
Used wrapper classes like:
- Integer.SIZE
- Byte.SIZE
- Long.SIZE

## Tools Used
- Notepad
- Command Prompt (Windows)

## Output
Printed values using 
```java
System.out.println();
```
Reflection:
Today I understood how Java programs are written, compiled, and executed from the command line.
